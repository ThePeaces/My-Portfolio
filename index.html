        <h3 class="heading-content1">There is my skill in Frontend Developer or in Professional Skills</h3>
        <p>My skills in Frontend have been useful for my friends and my class at SMK Krian 1,
            although sometimes I often collaborate with my friends to create a website specifically
            for my own class, and my professional skills in the field of graphic design help my brother in the
            DKV department, which was chosen by my brother.
            I think my skills are still beginners in Frontend and I think I need to improve my skills in that area.</p>
